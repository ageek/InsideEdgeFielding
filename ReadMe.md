Inside Edge Fielding Model
----

This is a repository with the code and data to recreate the analysis contained in [this post](http://andland.github.io/blog/2014/04/22/yet-another-baseball-defensive-statistic/).

The data I used to run the analysis is in `InsideEdgeFielding2012-2013.csv`, the code used to run the analysis is in `InsideEdgeFieldingModelUpload.R`, the resulting estimates are in `Shiny/InsideEdgeModelResults.csv`, and the code to create the [Shiny app](http://spark.rstudio.com/andland/InsideEdgeBaseballFielding/) are in the three `.R` files in `Shiny/`.
